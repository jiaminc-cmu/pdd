# To create a unit test for the `comment_line` function, we will assume that the function is located in a module named `comment_line.py` within the `staging/pdd` directory. The unit test will be placed in the `staging/tests` directory. We will use `pytest` for writing the unit test.

# Here's how you can set up the unit test:

# 1. **Directory Structure:**

#    ```
#    staging/
#    ├── pdd/
#    │   └── comment_line.py
#    └── tests/
#        └── test_comment_line.py
#    ```

# 2. **Unit Test Code (`staging/tests/test_comment_line.py`):**

#    ```python
import pytest
from pdd.comment_line import comment_line

def test_comment_line_single_character():
    # Test for single comment character (Python style)
    assert comment_line("print('Hello World!')", "#") == "#print('Hello World!')"

def test_comment_line_encapsulating_comments():
    # Test for encapsulating comments (HTML style)
    assert comment_line("<h1>Hello World!</h1>", "<!-- -->") == "<!--<h1>Hello World!</h1>-->"

def test_comment_line_deletion():
    # Test for deletion case
    assert comment_line("some code", "del") == ""

def test_comment_line_custom_encapsulating():
    # Test for custom encapsulating comments
    assert comment_line("SELECT * FROM users;", "/* */") == "/*SELECT * FROM users;*/"

def test_comment_line_no_comment_characters():
    # Test for no comment characters (should return the line as is)
    assert comment_line("int a = 0;", "") == "int a = 0;"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
#    ```

# 3. **Explanation of the Unit Test:**

#    - **`test_comment_line_single_character`**: Tests the function with a single comment character, such as Python's `#`.
#    - **`test_comment_line_encapsulating_comments`**: Tests the function with encapsulating comment characters, such as HTML's `<!-- -->`.
#    - **`test_comment_line_deletion`**: Tests the function with the `del` keyword, which should result in an empty string.
#    - **`test_comment_line_custom_encapsulating`**: Tests the function with custom encapsulating comment characters, such as SQL's `/* */`.
#    - **`test_comment_line_no_comment_characters`**: Tests the function with no comment characters, which should return the line unchanged.

# 4. **Running the Tests:**

#    To run the tests, navigate to the `staging/tests` directory and execute the following command:

#    ```bash
#    pytest test_comment_line.py
#    ```

# This setup will ensure that the `comment_line` function is tested for various scenarios, verifying its correctness across different types of comment styles.
