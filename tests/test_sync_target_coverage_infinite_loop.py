def test_target_coverage_infinite_loop_replication():
    """
    Test that verifies the fix for the infinite loop from sync_regression.sh test 3c.
    
    This test reproduces the exact scenario and verifies the fix:
    1. sync --target-coverage 95.0 simple_math
    2. Test files get created successfully (cmd_test_main works)
    3. sync_determine_operation tries to request more 'test' operations
    4. NEW FIX: Consecutive test operation protection kicks in after 3 attempts
    5. Loop is broken gracefully and sync terminates successfully
    
    This test should PASS with the fix implemented, demonstrating that
    the infinite loop protection is working correctly.
