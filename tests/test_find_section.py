# Certainly! I'll create a unit test for the `find_section` function using pytest. The test will be placed in the 'staging/tests' directory, and the code under test will be in the 'staging/pdd' directory. Here's the unit test:

# ```python
# File: staging/tests/test_find_section.py

import pytest
from pdd.find_section import find_section

def test_find_section_basic():
    lines = [
        "Some text",
        "```python",
        "def hello():",
        "    print('Hello, World!')",
        "```",
        "More text",
        "```javascript",
        "console.log('Hello, World!');",
        "```"
    ]
    expected = [
        ("python", 1, 4),
        ("javascript", 6, 8)
    ]
    assert find_section(lines) == expected

def test_find_section_nested():
    lines = [
        "```python",
        "def outer():",
        "    ```sql",
        "    SELECT * FROM table",
        "    ```",
        "    return 'Done'",
        "```"
    ]
    expected = [("python", 0, 6)]
    assert find_section(lines) == expected

def test_find_section_unclosed():
    lines = [
        "Some text",
        "```python",
        "def unclosed():",
        "    print('This block is not closed')"
    ]
    expected = [("python", 1, 3)]

    ]
    expected = [
        ("python", 0, 9),
        ("ruby", 10, 12)
    ]
    assert find_section(lines) == expected

def test_find_section_start_index():
    lines = [
        "Ignore this",
        "```python",
        "print('Hello')",
        "```",

        "```"
    ]
    expected = [("javascript", 4, 6)]
    assert find_section(lines, start_index=3) == expected

def test_find_section_sub_section():
    lines = [
        "```python",
        "def outer():",
        "    ```sql",

# ```

# This test file covers various scenarios:

# 1. Basic functionality with multiple code blocks
# 2. Nested code blocks
# 3. Unclosed code blocks
# 4. Empty input (no code blocks)
# 5. Multiple nested code blocks
# 6. Using a custom start index
# 7. Testing the sub-section functionality

# To run these tests, make sure you have pytest installed (`pip install pytest`) and run the following command from the root directory of your project:

# ```
# pytest staging/tests/test_find_section.py
# ```

# This test suite should provide good coverage for the `find_section` function and help ensure its correct functionality across various scenarios.
