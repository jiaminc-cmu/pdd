#Certainly! I'll create a unit test for the `postprocess_0` function using pytest. Here's a comprehensive unit test that ensures the correct functionality of the code under test:
#
#```python
import pytest
from pdd.postprocess_0 import postprocess_0

def test_postprocess_0():
    # Test input
    llm_output = '''This is some text before the code.

```python
def example_function():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return 42
```

This is some text between code blocks.

```bash
echo "This is a bash command"
```

This is some text after the code.

```python
print("This is another Python code block")
def another_function():
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
