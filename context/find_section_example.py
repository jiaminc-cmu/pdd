# Here's a concise example of how to use the `find_section` function from the `find_section.py` module, along with documentation for the input and output parameters.

# ### Example Usage

# ```python
# Import the find_section function from the module
from pdd.find_section import find_section

# Sample input: a string containing multiple lines, including code blocks
llm_output = """
Here is some text.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Some more text.

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Greetings!");
}
```
"""

# Split the output into lines
lines = llm_output.splitlines()

# Call the find_section function to extract code sections
sections = find_section(lines)

# Print the results
for code_language, start_line, end_line in sections:
    print(f"Language: {code_language}, Start: {start_line}, End: {end_line}")

# load ./context/unrunnable_raw_llm_output.py
with open('./context/unrunnable_raw_llm_output.py', 'r') as file:
    llm_output = file.read()
    
lines = llm_output.splitlines()
sections = find_section(lines)
for code_language, start_line, end_line in sections:
    print(f"Language: {code_language}, Start: {start_line}, End: {end_line}")
# ```

# ### Documentation

# #### Input Parameters
# - `lines` (List[str]): A list of strings, where each string represents a line of text. This is typically obtained by splitting a larger string into lines using `splitlines()`.
# - `start_index` (int, optional): The index in the `lines` list from which to start searching for code sections. Defaults to `0`.
# - `sub_section` (bool, optional): A flag indicating whether to treat the search as a sub-section. Defaults to `False`.

# #### Output
# - Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
#   - `code_language` (str): The programming language specified in the code block (e.g., "python", "javascript").
#   - `start_line` (int): The index of the line where the code block starts.
#   - `end_line` (int): The index of the line where the code block ends.

# ### Example Output
# For the provided `llm_output`, the output would be:
# ```
# Language: python, Start: 3, End: 6
# Language: javascript, Start: 10, End: 14
# ```

# This indicates that there are two code sections found: one in Python and one in JavaScript, along with their respective start and end line indices.
