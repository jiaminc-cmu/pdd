# Here's a concise example of how to use the `comment_line` function from the `comment_line.py` module, along with documentation for the input and output parameters.

# ### `comment_line.py`

# ```python
# def comment_line(code_line, comment_characters):
#     """
#     Comments out a line of code based on the provided comment characters.

#     Parameters:
#     code_line (str): The line of code to be commented out.
#     comment_characters (str): The comment characters to use. 
#                               - If 'del', the line will be deleted.
#                               - If it contains a space, it should be in the format 'start_comment end_comment'.
#                               - Otherwise, it is treated as a single comment character.

#     Returns:
#     str: The commented line of code or an empty string if deleted.
#     """
#     # Check if the language requires deletion of the line
#     if comment_characters == 'del':
#         return ''
    
#     # Check if the language uses separate start and end comment characters
#     if ' ' in comment_characters:
#         start_comment, end_comment = comment_characters.split(' ', 1)
#         return f"{start_comment}{code_line}{end_comment}"
    
#     # For languages with a single comment character
#     return f"{comment_characters}{code_line}"
# # ```

# ### Example Usage

# ```python
# Import the function from the module
from comment_line import comment_line

# Example 1: Python style comment
python_comment = comment_line("print('Hello World!')", "#")
print(python_comment)  # Output: "#print('Hello World!')"

# Example 2: HTML style comment
html_comment = comment_line("<h1>Hello World!</h1>", "<!-- -->")
print(html_comment)  # Output: "<!--<h1>Hello World!</h1>-->"

# Example 3: Language with no comment character (deletion)
deleted_line = comment_line("some code", "del")
print(deleted_line)  # Output: ""
# ```

# ### Explanation of Parameters
# - **Input Parameters**:
#   - `code_line` (str): The line of code you want to comment out.
#   - `comment_characters` (str): The characters used for commenting. It can be a single character, a pair of characters separated by a space, or the string `'del'` to delete the line.

# - **Output**:
#   - Returns a string that represents the commented line of code or an empty string if the line is deleted.
