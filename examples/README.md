# Examples

This directory contains examples that demonstrate comparisons between using Cursor and Prompt-Driven Development (PDD) for various programming tasks. These examples serve as practical illustrations of how PDD can be used to generate and modify code, via the pdd sync command, and how it compares to traditional development approaches.

## Available Examples

### Handpaint
The handpaint example demonstrates how PDD can be used to create and modify a painting application. This example shows:
- How PDD can be used to generate code for a graphical application
- The process of iteratively refining code through PDD
- A comparison between traditional development and PDD-assisted development

More examples will be added to this directory as they are developed.

## Purpose
These examples are designed to help developers understand:
1. The capabilities of PDD in different programming contexts
2. How PDD compares to traditional development workflows
3. Best practices for using PDD effectively
4. Real-world applications of PDD in various domains

Each example includes documentation and code that can be used as a reference for your own PDD-based development projects.
