# Module: edit_file_tool/think_tool.py

## Role and Responsibilities
This module is responsible for defining and implementing the "think" tool for the Claude model. The primary purpose of this tool is to provide a dedicated, private "scratchpad" for the model to externalize its reasoning process. By using this tool, the model can break down complex file editing tasks, plan its approach, and reflect on its actions without adding this cognitive overhead to the main conversation history. This significantly reduces token usage and improves the quality and accuracy of complex edits.

Key responsibilities include:
1.  **Tool Schema Definition**: Define the precise name, description, and input schema for the `think` tool, ensuring it is compatible with the Anthropic API.
2.  **Tool Implementation**: Provide a callable, no-op implementation for the tool. The client-side logic is minimal, as the core functionality is handled by the model and the Anthropic backend.
3.  **Integration Interface**: Structure the tool definition so it can be easily imported and integrated into the list of tools provided to the Anthropic API client by other parts of the application (e.g., an API service module).

## Model Integration Requirements
- **Model**: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- **Required Tools**: This module defines one of the tools, `think`, which will be used alongside `text_editor_20250124`.
- **API Features**: The tool must be compatible with Anthropic's `tool_use` feature.
- **Concept**: The implementation must understand that the `think` tool is a special case. Its value lies not in its client-side execution, but in providing a structured way for the model to reason, which the Anthropic backend can process efficiently. For more information on tool use, refer to the Anthropic documentation: <web>https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview</web>

## Requirements
1.  **Functional Requirements**:
    - The module must define a tool with the exact name `think`.
    - The tool must accept a single, required string parameter named `thought`.
    - The tool's description must clearly state that it is a private scratchpad for the model to think, plan, or take notes, and that the user will not see its output.
    - The implementation of the tool's logic must be a "no-op" (no operation). It should not perform any file I/O, network requests, or complex computations.
    - When used, the tool must return a simple, consistent, and short success message as a string, such as `"OK, I have noted that."`. 

2.  **Performance Requirements**:
    - The tool's execution must be instantaneous and non-blocking. As a synchronous no-op, it should introduce negligible overhead.

3.  **Error Handling Requirements**:
    - The tool's implementation should not raise any exceptions under normal operating conditions (i.e., when called with a string argument).

4.  **Documentation Requirements**:
    - The module, and any classes or functions, must have comprehensive docstrings following the Google Python Style Guide.
    - All functions, methods, and parameters must include type hints.
    - The docstrings should explain the unique purpose of the `think` tool as a cognitive offloading mechanism for the LLM.

## Dependencies
This module is foundational and should be self-contained with no internal dependencies on other `edit_file_tool` modules.

- **Standard Library**:
  - `typing`: For `Dict`, `Any`, and other type hints.

- **Third-party**:
  - None.

- **Internal**:
  - None.

## Integration Points Analysis
This module is a low-level utility designed to be consumed by higher-level services.
- **Downward Dependency Only**: This module MUST NOT depend on any other modules within the `edit_file_tool` project.
- **Caller Integration**: This module will be imported and used by the component responsible for making API calls to Anthropic (e.g., `edit_file_tool/anthropic_service.py`). That service will:
    1. Import the tool definition from this module.
    2. Add the `think` tool to the list of tools sent in the `messages.create` API call.
    3. When the model returns a `tool_use` block for the `think` tool, the service will call the tool's implementation logic and pass the result back to the model.

Here is an example of how a caller might integrate and use tools with the Anthropic API:
<include>examples/claude_api_example.py</include>

## Implementation Instructions
1.  **File Creation**: Create a new file named `edit_file_tool/think_tool.py`.

2.  **Class Structure**: Define a class named `ThinkTool` to encapsulate the tool's definition and logic. This keeps the implementation organized and namespaced.

3.  **Tool Definition**:
    - Implement a static or class method within `ThinkTool` called `get_definition()` that returns the tool's schema as a dictionary.
    - The schema must conform to the Anthropic API's tool format.
    - **`name`**: The tool's name must be exactly `"think"`.
    - **`description`**: Use a clear description, for example: `"A tool for the model to think step-by-step, plan, and record notes. This is a private scratchpad. The user will not see the output of this tool."`
    - **`input_schema`**: Define a JSON schema for the input. It must be an object with one required property:
        - `thought`: A string property. Its description should guide the model on its use, e.g., `"The thought process, reflection, or plan to be noted."`. 

4.  **Tool Logic**:
    - Implement a static or class method named `use(thought: str) -> dict`. This method will be called by the API service when the model uses the tool.
    - The `thought` parameter will receive the content from the model's thinking step.
    - This method should perform no action with the `thought` string.
    - It must return a dictionary containing a single key, `output`, with a simple string value like `"OK, I have noted that."`. 

5.  **Code Style and Quality**:
    - Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
    - Ensure all code is fully type-hinted.
    - Write clear and comprehensive docstrings for the module, the class, and all methods.

## Key Functions and Classes

```python
# Desired structure for edit_file_tool/think_tool.py

from typing import Dict, Any

class ThinkTool:
    """
    Encapsulates the definition and no-op implementation of the 'think' tool.

    This tool provides a private scratchpad for the Claude model to externalize
    its reasoning process, improving token efficiency and planning for complex tasks.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def get_definition() -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Returns the Anthropic-compatible tool definition for the 'think' tool.
        """
        # ... implementation ...

    @staticmethod
    def use(thought: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """
        Executes the 'think' tool. This is a no-op that returns a simple
        confirmation, as the tool's purpose is cognitive offloading for the model.

        Args:
            thought: The string content of the model's thought process.

        Returns:
            A dictionary with an 'output' key confirming the thought was noted.
        """
        # ... implementation ...
```

## Deliverables
1.  **Complete Python Module**: The full implementation of `edit_file_tool/think_tool.py` containing the `ThinkTool` class as specified.
2.  **Unit Tests**: A corresponding test file `tests/test_think_tool.py` with comprehensive unit tests.
    - Test that `get_definition()` returns a dictionary with the correct structure (`name`, `description`, `input_schema`).
    - Test that `use()` accepts a string and returns the expected dictionary output.
    - Tests should not require any external dependencies or API calls.
3.  **Documentation**: Full docstrings and type hints for all code, following Google style.
4.  **Error Handling**: The implementation should be robust and not raise errors during normal operation.
