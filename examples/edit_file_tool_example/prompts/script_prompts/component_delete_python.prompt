Create a python script that can be used to delete all the files for a component.

The script should take a single argument, which is the name of the component.
The script should delete the following files:
- `edit_file_tool/<component_name>*.py`
- `examples/<component_name>*.py`
- `tests/test_<component_name>*.py`
- `.pdd/meta/<component_name>_python*` (including .json, .yaml, and .yml files)
- `make_creation/<component_name>/` (the entire directory)

The script should NOT delete the prompt file: `prompts/<component_name>_python.prompt`. This is a protected folder.

The script should have a `--dry-run` option that will print out the files that would be deleted, but not actually delete them.
The script should have a `--force` option that will skip the confirmation prompt.
If neither `--dry-run` nor `--force` is specified, the script should prompt the user for confirmation before deleting the files.

The script should be well-documented and have a main function.
The script should use the `argparse` module to parse the command-line arguments.
The script should use the `os` and `shutil` modules to delete the files and directories.
The script should handle cases where files or directories do not exist gracefully.
The script should print out informative messages about what it is doing.
