Create a bash script that loads environment variables from Infisical for the current shell session.

The script must perform the following steps:
1. Include a comment at the top explaining its purpose and usage, for example: `Usage: source scripts/setup_env_from_infisical.sh`.
2. Check if the `infisical` command-line tool is installed. If it's not found, print an error message with instructions on how to install it (`npm install -g @infisical/cli`) and exit with a non-zero status.
3. Check if the user is logged into Infisical. If they are not, print a message instructing them to run `infisical login` and exit with a non-zero status.
4. Fetch secrets from the `prod` environment using the `dotenv` format, and export them as environment variables.
5. Print a success message after the variables have been loaded.
6. Add a verification step that prints the status of the following key variables:
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    - `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT`
    - `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION`
7. For security, when verifying the API keys, display only the first 10 characters of each key's value.
