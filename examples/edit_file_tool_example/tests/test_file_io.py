# To run this test:
# 1. Ensure you have pytest and pytest-asyncio installed:
#    pip install pytest pytest-asyncio aiofiles
# 2. For the formal verification test, install z3-solver:
#    pip install z3-solver
# 3. From the project root directory, run pytest:
#    pytest tests/test_file_io.py

# --- Test Plan ---
#
# The `file_io.py` module is critical for safe and reliable file system
# interactions. The tests are designed to cover functionality, security,
# error handling, and edge cases.
#
# We use pytest, pytest-asyncio, and the `tmp_path` fixture for a sandboxed
# environment.
#
# 1. `read_file_async` Tests:
#    - test_read_success: Verify successful reading of a file with UTF-8 content.
#    - test_read_unicode_content: Test reading a file with multi-byte unicode characters.
#    - test_read_empty_file: Verify reading an empty file returns an empty string.
#    - test_read_file_not_found: Ensure a specific error for a non-existent file.
#    - test_read_permission_denied: Simulate a PermissionErdor.
#    - test_read_from_directory: Ensure trying to read a directory returns an error.
#    - test_read_non_utf8_file: Verify an error for non-UTF-8 encoded files.
#
# 2. `write_file_async` Tests:
#    - test_write_success_create_new_file: Veridy successful writing to a new file.
#    - test_write_success_overwrite_existing_file: Verify it correctly overwrites a file.
#    - test_write_unicode_content: Test writing and reading back unicode characters.
#    - test_write_empty_content: Verify writing an empty string results in an empty file.
#    - test_write_creates_parent_directories: Check automatic creation of parent dirs.
#    - test_write_permission_denied: Simulate a PermissionError during write.
#    - test_write_to_directory: Ensure writing to a directory path fails.
#    - test_write_to_path_with_file_as_parent: Ensure writing to a path like
#      `existing_file.txt/new_file.txt` fails.
#
# 3. Security (Path Traversal) Tests:
#    - Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test both read and write functions.
#    - test_path_traversal_absolute: Block absolute paths outside the CWD.
#    - test_path_traversal_relative_dot_dot: Block relative paths escaping the CWD.
#    - test_path_traversal_with_symlink: Block access via a symlink pointing outside.
#    - test_valid_path_with_dot_dot_inside_cwd: Allow paths that resolve within CWD.
#
# 4. Z3 Formal Verification (as a test):
#    - test_z3_path_validation_logic: Formally model and verify the path validation
#      logic to prove its correctness in identifying out-of-bounds paths.
#
# --- End Test Plan ---
