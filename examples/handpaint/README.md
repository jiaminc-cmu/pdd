# HandPaint Example

HandPaint is an interactive drawing application that uses computer vision to enable natural drawing interactions. Users can draw using their finger as a pen and erase using their palm, creating an intuitive and hands-free drawing experience.

## Features
- Finger-based drawing: Use your index finger to draw on the screen
- Palm-based erasing: Use your palm to erase parts of your drawing
- Real-time interaction: Immediate response to hand movements
- Camera-based tracking: Uses your device's camera to track hand movements

## Comparison with Vibecoding

### Time & Interaction
- [**Vibecoding**](./cursor/README.md)
  - Active work: 38 minutes (100% user attention required)
  - Total prompts: 11
  - Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

- [**PDD**](./pdd/README.md)
  - Total session: 41 minutes
  - Background processing: ~24 minutes (automated, user can multitask)
  - Active user time: ~17 minutes (58% less active time required)
  - Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview

### Cost Analysis (PDD)
Total cost for 8 runs: ≈ $1.52
Average cost per run: ≈ $0.19

### Feature Comparison Chart

| Feature | Vibecoding | PDD | Advantage |
|---------|------------|-----|-----------|
| Active User Time | 38 min | 17 min | PDD: 55% less active time |
| Multitasking | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | PDD: Users can work on other tasks |
| Cost Efficiency | Higher | $1.52 | PDD: More cost-effective |
| Setup Flexibility | Limited | Customizable | PDD: Adaptable to user needs |
| Processing Mode | Real-time | Background | PDD: More efficient resource usage |

### Quality & Reliability
- **Vibecoding**
  - Provides a straightforward drawing experience
  - Good default settings for basic use cases

- **PDD**
  - Functional with minor bugs
  - Requires knowledge of prompt engineering

### Key Advantages of PDD
1. **Time Efficiency**: 55% reduction in active user time
2. **Multitasking**: Users can work on other tasks during background processing
3. **Cost-Effective**: Only $0.19 per run
4. **Flexibility**: Customizable setup and prompt tuning
5. **Resource Optimization**: Background processing reduces system load

### Overall Assessment

PDD demonstrates clear advantages over Vibecoding in terms of user time efficiency and cost-effectiveness. While Vibecoding offers a more polished initial experience, PDD provides superior value through:
- 55% reduction in active user time
- Ability to multitask during processing
- Cost-effective implementation at just $0.19 per run
- Flexible customization options

The minor technical glitches in PDD are easily addressable through prompt tuning, making it the more practical choice for users who value efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

The PDD example was created by a naive user who only utilized the basic PDD sync function without following the complete PDD lifecycle. This limited implementation doesn't showcase PDD's full potential. When properly implemented following the PDD lifecycle, including proper prompt engineering, iterative refinement, and comprehensive testing, PDD can achieve significantly better results with even higher efficiency and reliability. Furthermore, it's important to note that the two tests used different models - Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview. As different models have varying strengths and capabilities, the comparison might have yielded different results if both approaches had used the same model.
