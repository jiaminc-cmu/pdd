% You are an expert in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will write a single HTML file that does the following:
% 1. Accesses the user’s webcam via getUserMedia and displays the live camera feed as the background of the page (not a black screen). The live feed should mirror the user.
% 2. Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect and draw the hand skeleton on top of the live video. Add a dot at the middle of the palm as well. 
% 3. Uses Three.js to overlay interactive drawing:
% a) When the user’s hand is an open palm, enter “erase” mode: Treat the dot at the middle of the palm as a pixel eraser. 
% b) When the user is pointing their index finger, enter “draw” mode: draw one line that follows the tip of the index finger when it is extended at any angle.
% 4. Ensure the camera feed is visible at all times, with the MediaPipe skeleton and drawing layer composited over it.
% 5. Provide proper initialization so the Three.js renderer uses the video feed texture and renders the drawing and skeleton in real time.
% 6. Include comments to show where the camera feed is set up, where MediaPipe is initialized, and where drawing/erasing logic is implemented.
